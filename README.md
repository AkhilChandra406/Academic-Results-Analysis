## 📘 **Student Results Analysis – Simple Summary**

### ✅ **What is the Project About?**

* Analyzing students' scores in Math, Reading, and Writing.
* Finding how different factors affect student performance.

---

### 🎯 **What Problem Does It Solve?**

* Helps understand which factors (like gender, parents’ education, study hours) impact scores.
* Useful for teachers, schools, or parents to support students better.

---

### 🔧 **Technologies Used**

* **Python** – programming language
* **Pandas** – for handling data
* **NumPy** – for calculations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – for creating graphs and charts

---

### 📊 **What Analysis Was Done?**

* Checked missing data and fixed formatting issues.
* Analyzed how:

  * Gender affects performance
  * Parent education level affects scores
  * Marital status of parents impacts results
  * Score distributions (found outliers)
* Counted students in each ethnic group

---

### 📈 **What Did You Find?**

* Students with more educated parents scored better.
* Parent marital status also affected performance slightly.
* Some students had very low or very high scores (outliers).
* Gender and ethnic group had some impact on scores.

---

### 🚀 **What Can Be Done Next?**

* Predict scores using machine learning.
* Analyze more features like lunch type or test prep.
* Create a dashboard or app to show results interactively.
